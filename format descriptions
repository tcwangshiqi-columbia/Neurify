The format of .nnet in Neurify is customized from Reluplex and ReluVal.

Here is a detailed description for nnet format:
===================
line1: // comment for this network
line2: layer number (include output layer but exclude input layer), input dimension, output dimension, maximal number of nodes for each layer
line3: Whether each layer is convolutional (e.g., 1,1,0,0 means totally 4 layers and the previous two are convolutional layers while the last two are fully connected)
line4 and later: each line describes the information for convolutional layers as $out_channel, in_channel, kernel, stride, padding$
===================



transfer.py is a sample code for transferring the tensorflow/keras models to nnet format. Due to the version problem or model definitions, chances are high that one needs to slightly change the code to transfer one's models successfully. Note that one must check closely whether the returned outputs of transferred nnet model are the same as the outputs of your own network under tensorflow/keras.
