1) Edit `makefile` to change paths to the relevant paths where you have things installed to.
2) `make`
3) `cp libentails.so ~/home/username/your/lib/dir`
4) Make sure your .so dir is in your ld library path by doing `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/your/lib/dir:$PATH`
5) `cp entails.h /home/username/your/include/dir`

NB. Need to compile lp_solve on your own machine if this version doesn't work.
